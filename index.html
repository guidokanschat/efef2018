      <h1>16<sup>th</sup> European Finite Element Fair 2018</h1>
      <h2> June 8 - 9, 2018, Mathematikon, Heidelberg</h2>
      
      <p>The 16<sup>th</sup> European Finite Element Fair will be held
	at Heidelberg University. It will be hosted in the new
	<a href="https://mathematikon.de/">Mathematikon</a> building
	on the science campus Im Neuenheimer Feld.
      </p>
      
      <p> The conference will begin June 8<sup>th</sup> at 14:00
	(on-site registration opening at 12:30) and end June 9<sup>th</sup> in the

      <h3>The EFEF Meetings</h3>
      <p>The European Finite Element Fair (EFEF) is an annual series
	of completely informal small workshops throughout Europe with
	equal initial conditions for each speaker. EFEF provides a
	platform for high-level discussions on current research on
	finite element approximation, in the broadest sense, of
	partial differential equations. Authors are encouraged to
	present <b>one</b> new idea rather than review a full research
	project. In this spirit, the communication of recent and new
	results, even not yet published, is very welcome. A few, but
	strict, rules apply to EFEF in order to distinguish it from
	existing workshops and minisymposia in the field.</p>

      <h3>Format of the Meeting</h3>
      <ul>	    
	<li>Speakers at EFEF are volunteers from the
	audience. Provided that they are present throughout the
	meeting, all participants are invited to talk.  Potential
	participants are strongly encouraged to attend at least one
	meeting before volunteering to speak.</li>
	<li>Based on the number of speakers the time available will be
	divided into slots for the talks. The order of the speakers
	will be determined through random choice, by drawing names out
	of a hat. Speakers cannot request a specific time to
	talk. </li>
	<li>The Presentations. Bring your presentation as a pdf-file
	on a USB-stick. That will make life/technical support much
	more relaxed and easier during the conference. </li>
	<li>Each speaker should introduce himself or herself, the
	title and topic, and is expected to leave sufficient time,
	within the allocated time-slot, for discussion. Speakers have
	to prepare a talk that can be trimmed to various lengths (from
	seconds to 20 minutes).  For a smooth meeting, the time table
	will be strictly enforced. </li>
	<li>The Book. Since EFEF 2005, a book has been available (in
	the Oberwolfach tradition) to record new analytical and
	numerical results presented during EFEF. Results can be
	hand-written or typeset and glued into the book.</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Early registration (with/without announcement of a presentation) is strongly encouraged to help the local organizers to foresee the number of participants and speakers. Registration immediately before the EFEF remains possible and relevant.-->
